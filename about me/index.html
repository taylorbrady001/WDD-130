    <h2>Taylor Brady</h2>
    <p> Hello there every one! I am Web Design and Develpment major and a cluster in film. I love basketball and movies.
        I've always been interest in web design. I was lucky enough to have the option to take some web design classes in High School. 
        i love being able to create things for people to use. In my eyes, its a art to be able to do Frontend Develpment in this workforce. 
        Everyone uses websites. Its a need now in days. Because of that i want to learn more about it. Its one of the advantages of web design. 
    </p>
    <p> I was born into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. 
        I served a teaching mission in Californa Santa Rosa then i finished as a service missionary in the Utah Orem Mission.
        My favorite quote is "I love you"- God
