                <h3>Non Conformace Application</h3>
              <p>This application made it possible to quickly fill out Non Conformace. 
                This app sent the steps to the right people in seconds. We improved a processthat
                 used to take months to less then a week. This app tracked errors in a printing
                  process for The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints.
              </p>
    
              <h3>Product Voting Suite</h3>
              <p>In this application, users were able to make and design their
                 own temple clothing. They pick from the designs on the app to design 
                 what they want and need for their clothing.

              <h3>Business Process & Quality Systems</h3>
              <p>This app tracked a process for shipping. We could see where it was at and if there was any problems. 
                If there was, we could fill out the required paper work through the app. Then it would be sent instantly
                 to people for the next step. This made the process go from months to days.

              <h3>Global Training Videos FOr D365- ERP System</h3>
              <p>In these videos, I helped edit and cut to help people learn how to use the program called D365.
